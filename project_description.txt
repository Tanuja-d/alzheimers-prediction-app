Alzheimer's Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project applies various machine learning algorithms to predict Alzheimer's Disease using clinical data. 
The dataset includes features like Functional Assessment, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Memory Complaints.

Algorithms Implemented:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering (unsupervised)
- Random Forest (selected for deployment)

Outcome:
After comparing the accuracy of the implemented models, Random Forest achieved the highest prediction accuracy. 
Hence, it was selected for deployment in a Streamlit web application that accepts user input and gives a prediction.

Included Files:
- RANDOM_FOREST.ipynb: Notebook with model training and accuracy
- Other notebooks: Contain model experiments with Logistic Regression, SVM, and K-Means
- alzheimers_disease_data.csv: The dataset used for training
- Streamlit app (not shown here): Loads RandomForest model for prediction

To run the app, use:
    streamlit run app.py
